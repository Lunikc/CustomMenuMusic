# CustomMenuMusic

## Custom Menu Music v1.2.0

## Now managed by **Steven** at [CustomMenuMusic](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/CustomMenuMusic)

Changes the music in the menu, now you can use either a randomly selected song from all downloaded maps, or use multiple songs selected at random from the `BeatSaber\CustomMenuSongs` folder.

### Configuration
By default it reads the `BeatSaber\CustomMenuSongs` folder.

To use songs from the `BeatSaber\CustomSongs` folder, simply go into `Beat Saber\modprefs.ini` and change `UseCustomMenuSongs` to `0`. 

All songs files **HAVE** to be `.ogg` format.
